# CommissionCalculator

I made this for my work colleague Ryan. 

He wouldn't know what his commision would be a the end of the month, so I made this simple app using Vue.

I didn't use the CLI as that was a bit overkill. I used the CDN, added some styling with bootstrap and some logic. 

He loves it!
